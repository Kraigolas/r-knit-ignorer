# r-knit-ignorer
This project aims to automate adding knitted files generated by RStudio to your .gitignore
to ensure they are not backed up.

# How do I use this 
If you haven't implemented a pre-commit hook, simply download this file and paste it into 
your repository's .git/hooks folder. Otherwise, append this to your already existing 
pre-commit file. 

**Note: default, pre-commit.sample exists as a hook. Do not append this script to 
pre-commit.sample or it will not work.** 

# How does it work 
If a file myfile.Rmd resides in the repository, the default knitting behaviour when knitting to pdf or to html 
is to simply take the basename "myfile" and add on the extension. As a result, we want to ignore myfile.pdf 
and myfile.html. 

When a new .Rmd file is created and committed, this script runs prior to the commit to 
1. Unstage any .html or .pdf files that may have already been knitted from the newly created .Rmd file, and 
2. Add the .html and .pdf files to the .gitignore in your repository 

**Note: This only works if your knitted files share the same basename as the Rmd file** 

# Additional Info 
1. The extension .Rmd is searched for in a case-insensitive manner
2. The extensions .pdf and .html are **case sensitive**
